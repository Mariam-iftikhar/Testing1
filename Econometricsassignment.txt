#price = b0 + b1sqrft + b2bdrms +1 u

# where price is the house price measured in thousands of dollars.
#(i) Write out the results in equation form.
 
 
hprice1

# price= B0 + B1sqrft + B2bdrms + U

hprice1.effect <- lm(price ~ sqrft + bdrms, data =  hprice1)
summary(hprice1.effect)


# y.fitted <- mapply(function(i, j) {
#   y.hat <- -19.31500 + (0.12844 * i) + (15.19819 * j)
#   return(y.hat)
# }, hprice1$sqrft, hprice1$bdrms)

# y.fitted



#(ii) What is the estimated increase in price for a house with one more bedroom, holding square 
#footage constant?

estimatedprice <- -19.31500 + (0.12844 * 0) + (15.19819 * 1)
estimatedprice

#Explanation: 
#Given that the price is in the thousands, the anticipated rise in price from adding just one more bedroom, 
#while keeping the square footage constant, is $15,198.



#(iii) What is the estimated increase in price for a house with an additional bedroom that is  
#140 square feet in size? Compare this to your answer in part (ii).

estimatedpricewithbdrmssqrt <- -19.31500 + (0.12844 * 140) + (15.19819 * 1)
estimatedpricewithbdrmssqrt

##Explanation: 
# Given that the price is in the thousands, the anticipated increase in the price of a house with an 
# extra bedroom measuring 140 square feet is $33,118 which is calculated as (0.12844 * 140) + (15.19819 * 1). 
# Since the size of the house is growing, this has a significantly greater impact compared to (ii).



#(iv) What percentage of the variation in price is explained by square footage and number  
#of bedrooms?
#Multiple R-squared:  0.6319

summary(hprice1.effect)$r.squared

#Explanation:
#The square footage and the number of bedrooms account for approximately 63.1% of the 
#variation seen in house prices.



#(v) The first house in the sample has sqrft = 2,438 and bdrms = 4. Find the predicted selling price 
#for this house from the OLS regression line.

firsthouse.predictedsellingprice <- -19.31500 + (0.12844 * 2438) + (15.19819 * 4)
firsthouse.predictedsellingprice

#firsthouse.predictedsellingprice= 354.6145

#Explanation:
#Since the price is in thousands, the estimated selling price is $354,6145.



#(vi) The actual selling price of the first house in the sample was $300,000 (so price = 300). Find 
#the residual for this house. Does it suggest that the buyer underpaid or overpaid for the house?


valuesold= 300- firsthouse.predictedsellingprice
valuesold 

#Explanation: 
#The buyer underpaid for this house: they bought it for $300,000, even though its estimated value is $354,6145.
