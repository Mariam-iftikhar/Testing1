#(i) Write out the results in equation form.

#(ii) What is the estimated increase in price for a house with one more bedroom, holding square 
#footage constant?

estimatedprice <- -19.31500 + (0.12844 * 0) + (15.19819 * 1)
estimatedprice

#Explanation: 
#Given that the price is in the thousands, the anticipated rise in price from adding just one more bedroom, 
#while keeping the square footage constant, is $15,198.



#(iii) What is the estimated increase in price for a house with an additional bedroom that is  
#140 square feet in size? Compare this to your answer in part (ii).

estimatedpricewithbdrmssqrt <- -19.31500 + (0.12844 * 140) + (15.19819 * 1)
estimatedpricewithbdrmssqrt

##Explanation: 
# Given that the price is in the thousands, the anticipated increase in the price of a house with an 
# extra bedroom measuring 140 square feet is $33,118 which is calculated as (0.12844 * 140) + (15.19819 * 1). 
# Since the size of the house is growing, this has a significantly greater impact compared to (ii).



#(iv) What percentage of the variation in price is explained by square footage and number  
#of bedrooms?
#Multiple R-squared:  0.6319

summary(hprice1.effect)$r.squared

#Explanation:
#The square footage and the number of bedrooms account for approximately 63.1% of the 
#variation seen in house prices.



#(v) The first house in the sample has sqrft = 2,438 and bdrms = 4. Find the predicted selling price 
#for this house from the OLS regression line.

firsthouse.predictedsellingprice <- -19.31500 + (0.12844 * 2438) + (15.19819 * 4)
firsthouse.predictedsellingprice

#firsthouse.predictedsellingprice= 354.6145

#Explanation:
#Since the price is in thousands, the estimated selling price is $354,6145.



#(vi) The actual selling price of the first house in the sample was $300,000 (so price = 300). Find 
#the residual for this house. Does it suggest that the buyer underpaid or overpaid for the house?


valuesold= 300- firsthouse.predictedsellingprice
valuesold 

#Explanation: 
#The buyer underpaid for this house: they bought it for $300,000, even though its estimated value is $354,6145.

# The file CEOSAL2 contains data on 177 chief executive officers and can be used to examine  
# the effects of firm performance on CEO salary.


#  (i) Estimate a model relating annual salary to firm sales and market value. Make the model 
# of the constant elasticity variety for both independent variables. Write the results out 
# in equation form.

#salary = B0 + B1lsales + B2lmktval + U

ceosal2.effect <- lm(salary ~ lsales + lmktval, data =  ceosal2)

# y.fitted <- mapply(function(a, b) {
#   y.hat <- -862.64 + (95.38 * a) + (140.39 * b)
#   return(y.hat)
# }, ceosal2$lsales, ceosal2$lmktval)

# y.fitted



#  (ii) Add profits to the model from part (i). Why can this variable not be included in logarithmic 
# form? Would you say that these firm performance variables explain most of the variation 
# in CEO salaries?

#salary = B0 + B1lsales + B2lmktval + B3profits + U

ceosal2.effectafterprofits <- lm(salary ~ lsales + lmktval + profits , data =  ceosal2)
summary(ceosal2.effectafterprofits)

# y.fittedafterupdated <- mapply(function(a, b,c) {
#   y.hat <- -571.8192 + (92.0297 * a) + (99.9486  * b) + (0.1571*c)
#   return(y.hat)
# }, ceosal2$lsales, ceosal2$lmktval,ceosal2$profits)

# y.fittedafterupdated

#Explanation:
#Multiple R-squared:  0.2246

# When incorporating profits into the model for CEO salaries, it's important to avoid using logarithmic form 
# if there are any instances of zero or negative profits. Logarithmic transformation cannot be applied to zero or 
# negative values, which can distort the analysis or result in errors. A Multiple R-squared value of 0.2246 indicates 
# that roughly 22.46% of the variation in CEO salaries can be accounted for by the model, which takes into 
# consideration sales, market value, and profits. While this shows a connection between firm performance and CEO 
# salaries, it also reveals that a substantial portion (around 77.54%) of the variation is not explained by these 
# factors.

# This implies that although firm performance is a factor in determining CEO compensation, other elements are likely 
# at play as well, including various non-performance-related criteria.
#  It may be beneficial to look into additional variables to enhance the model's accuracy.




# (iii)  Add the variable ceoten to the model in part (ii). What is the estimated percentage return for  
# another year of CEO tenure, holding other factors fixed?

#salary = B0 + B1lsales + B2lmktval + B3profits + B4ceoten + U

estimatedpercentagereturn

#Explanation: 
#For every additonal year of CEO tenure the estimated percentage return is 13,3529 dollars

# y.fittedafterceoten <- mapply(function(a, b,c,d) {
#   y.hat <- -719.4013 + (93.0189 * a) + (104.7839  * b) + (0.1496*c) + (13.3529* d)
#   return(y.hat)

# y.fittedafterceoten




#  (iv) Find the sample correlation coefficient between the variables log(mktval) and profits. Are these 
# variables highly correlated? What does this say about the OLS estimators?

correl= cor(ceosal2$lmktval,ceosal2$profits)
correl

# 0.7768976

#Explanation:
# The correlation coefficient of about 0.777 between log(mktval) and profits shows a strong positive relationship between these two factors. 
#This implies that as market value rises, profits are likely to rise as well.

# Implications for OLS Estimators:

# Multicollinearity: A significant correlation between independent variables (such as log(mktval) and profits) can 
# result in multicollinearity problems. This means that the independent variables might be offering overlapping 
# information in the regression model, which can lead to inflated standard errors for the coefficients. To address 
# these issues, you might consider strategies like removing one of the correlated variables, applying regularization 
# techniques (such as Ridge or Lasso regression), or conducting principal component analysis (PCA) to decrease dimensionality.
